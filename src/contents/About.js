                I had always been interested in Software Development but I always let fear hold me back. 
                I decided to take the leap into this field and I have no regrets! It has been an amazing 
                journey and I have learned so much already I am excited to continue to learn and grow as 
                a Software Developer.
                I am an avid problem solver who enjoys puzzles, word searches, and anything that challenges me. The challenge
                can be frustrating in the moment but the rush that you get when you finally solve it, it's the only adrenaline rush 
                I need.
